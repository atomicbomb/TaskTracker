- Entity Framework Core (SQLite)
- Async/await for API and DB
- System tray via Windows Forms NotifyIcon

### Key Services
- ApplicationService, ConfigurationService
- JiraApiService, TaskManagementService, TimeTrackingService
- TimerService (prompts, optional calendar scanning)
- SystemTrayService (tray icon + context menu)
- GoogleIntegrationService (OAuth + Calendar scan)

### ViewModels
- MainViewModel, SettingsViewModel
- JiraProjectsViewModel, JiraTasksViewModel
- SummaryViewModel (Daily/Weekly/Time Entries), TaskPromptViewModel

## Current Behaviors and UI Notes

- Time Entries view shows entries for the selected date only; date navigation appears in both Daily and Time Entries views.
- JIRA Projects form excludes projects with codes DEMO and TEST from its list.
- JIRA Tasks form includes Status (text) and a colored dot by statusCategory (To Do/In Progress/Done).
- Manual Task Update: available from the main window to set a current task manually.

## Setup

1) JIRA configuration
- In Settings, enter:
   - Server URL (e.g., https://yourcompany.atlassian.net)
   - Email and API Token (create at Atlassian Account ‚Üí Security ‚Üí API tokens)
- Use JIRA Projects/Tasks windows to load and select content.

2) Google Calendar (optional)
- In Settings, enable Google integration and provide Client ID/Client Secret from Google Cloud Console (OAuth 2.0, Desktop app/Installed app).
- The app uses the loopback (LocalServerCodeReceiver) OAuth flow and requests Calendar Readonly scope.
- After connecting, you can test and set a scan interval. Events containing "[ABC-123]" style keys in the title are detected and tasks are added if valid.

3) Tracking
- The app runs in the system tray. Prompts appear during configured hours.
- Use Summary to inspect/edit/delete entries; use JIRA Tasks to manage task list.

## Build & Run
