- **Dark/Light Theme**: Configurable UI themes
- **SQLite Database**: Local data storage for offline operation

## Architecture

- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns with ViewModels
- **Dependency Injection**: Service-based architecture
- **Entity Framework Core**: Database operations with SQLite
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations for API calls and database access

## Key Components

- `TaskManagementService`: Handles project and task management
- `TimerService`: Automated prompting and break management
- `SystemTrayService`: System tray icon and notifications
- `ConfigurationService`: Application and JIRA settings management

### ViewModels
- `TaskPromptViewModel`: Task selection and lunch break prompts
- `SummaryViewModel`: Time tracking reports and summaries
- `SettingsViewModel`: Application configuration
- `JiraProjectsViewModel`: Project selection and management
- `JiraTasksViewModel`: Task management
- `MainViewModel`: Main application window

### Models
- `JiraProject`: Project information from JIRA
- `JiraTask`: Task information from JIRA
- `TimeEntry`: Individual time tracking entries
- `AppSettings`: Application configuration
- `JiraSettings`: JIRA API configuration

## Getting Started

1. **Configure JIRA Settings**:

   - Set your tracking hours (when prompts should appear)

2. **Select Projects**:
   - Use "JIRA Projects" to fetch and select projects you want to track
   - Only selected projects will appear in task prompts

3. **Add Tasks**:
   - Use "JIRA Tasks" to fetch tasks from selected projects
   - Or manually add specific task numbers

4. **Start Tracking**:
   - The application will prompt you at configured intervals
   - Select your current task or indicate lunch breaks
   - View summaries to see your time allocation

## Configuration
